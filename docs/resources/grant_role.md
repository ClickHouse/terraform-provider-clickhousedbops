  You can use the clickhousedbops_grant_role resource to grant a clickhousedbops_role to either a clickhousedbops_user or to another clickhousedbops_role.
  Known limitations:
  It's not possible to grant the same clickhousedbops_role to both a clickhousedbops_user and a clickhousedbops_role using a single clickhousedbops_grant_role stanza.
